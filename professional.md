***tl;dr** I solve product and research problems that require ML/AI - especially computer vision, LLMs, and multimodal systems.*

## In a Nutshell

I help teams ship ML systems that have meaningful business impact - from problem framing and data pipelines, through model development and evaluation, to production deployment. My core domains are computer vision (images/video) and NLP/LLMs.

**I am a full-stack ML architect/applied researcher**, meaning I own the full lifecycle: research, data, training, evaluation, deployment. I have done this for both early-stage startups and large organizations.

**I love computer vision.** Yep, I literally love what I do, which means I'm always up to date. I’ve been working with images and videos for more than 10 years. These days a lot of that is generative work as well - using whichever approach is the right tool for the job. I also have a far-reaching background in computer graphics and classical image processing (that's actually where I started).

**But I also specialize in NLP/LLMs.** In recent years, a significant portion of my work has been about making LLMs useful in production: RAG systems, large-scale knowledge graphs (and traversal), *real* agentic workflows, and the evaluation + engineering needed to make them reliable and testable. This dual focus is especially handy for projects that bridge visual and textual domains.

**I also consider myself a capable software engineer** with a strong grasp of both Python and the usual collection of auxiliary tools/frameworks my work often requires. This includes everything from managing annotation databases to querying them - and building the tooling around them (e.g., vector search and analytics infrastructure).

## Experience
Since 2021 I’ve been working as an independent consultant, typically as the hands-on technical lead for ML execution.
Prior to that, I was a computer vision research manager at [Trigo](https://www.trigoretail.com){:target="_blank"}. Before *Trigo* I was a computer vision research scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}'s *Lab126*. I was also extremely lucky to work on my MSc thesis at [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com){:target="_blank"} as an Imagineering intern, under the supervision of [Prof. Arik Shamir](https://faculty.runi.ac.il/arik/site/index.asp){:target="_blank"}.


I hold an M.Sc and a B.Sc in Computer Science from the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel**, and a minor in Visual Communications from **Bezalel Academy for Art and Design**.

As a consultant I was lucky enough to work with 
[Deci.ai](https://www.nvidia.com){:target="_blank"},
[Lemonade](https://www.lemonade.com){:target="_blank"},
[Mixtiles](https://www.mixtiles.com){:target="_blank"},
[Papaya-Global](https://www.papayaglobal.com){:target="_blank"},
[Simply](https://www.hellosimply.com){:target="_blank"}, 
and more (including startups that were later acquired).
