***tl;dr** I solve problems that require deep learning/computer vision.*

## In a Nutshell

I am *damn good* at solving deep learning business problems and I've been doing that for some of Israel's top startups (see [Experience]({{ site.baseurl }}/professional/#experience)).

**I am a full-stack researcher**, meaning I do everything from research to data management to training and finally deployment. I am a highly experienced technological leader and researcher, with rich theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning techniques and their usage production environments.

**I love computer vision**. Yep, I literally *love* what I do, which means I'm always up tp date. I've been handling images in various tasks for more than 10 years. I've worked on cutting edge deep models and classical image processing techniques - whichever was the best tool for the job. I also have far reaching background in *computer graphics* (that's actually where I started).

**But I also love everything ML** and I've got ranging levels of experience with recommender systems and natural language processing too.

**My background ranges from tiny to huge organizations**, includes both individual contribution and management, and revolves around both the latest and deepest trends and the most barebones simple approaches. I have conducted research, trained and deployed models into real products used by real users.

**I also consider myself a capable data engineer** with a strong grasp of both Python and the usual collection of auxiliary tools/frameworks our craft requires. This includes everything from managing annotation databases to querying them.

## Experience
Before embarking on my freelance career I was a *computer vision research manager* at [trigo](https://www.trigoretail.com). Before *trigo* I was a *machine learning research scientist* at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)'s *Lab126*. I was also extremely luck to work on my MSc thesis at [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com) as an *Imagineering intern*.

I hold an M.Sc and a B.Sc in Computer Science from the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel**, and a minor in Visual Communications from **Bezalel Academy for Art and Design**.

As a freelancer I was lucky enough to work with

<a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, 
<a href="https://www.hellosimply.com/">Simply (formly Joytunes)</a>, 
<a href="https://www.mixtiles.com/">Mixtiles</a>, 
and some others.
