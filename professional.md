***tl;dr** I solve problems that require machine/deep learning.*

## In a Nutshell

I am highly skilled at solving deep learning business problems and I've been doing that for some of Israel's top startups (see [Experience]({{ site.baseurl}}/professional/#experience)). My main areas of expertise are computer vision and natural language processing.

**I love computer vision.** Yep, I literally love what I do, which means I'm always up to date. I've been studying images for various tasks for more than 10 years. I've worked on cutting edge deep models and classical image processing techniques - whichever was the best tool for the job. I also have far reaching background in computer graphics (that's actually where I started).

**But I specialize in both computer vision and natural language processing.** While computer vision has been my focus for over a decade, I've developed deep expertise in NLP, particularly with the rise of LLMs. In recent years, a significant portion of my work has involved incorporating these models into production environments. I've tackled challenges ranging from building large-scale knowledge graphs to developing RAGs and implementing agent-based workflows. This dual specialization allows me to bring unique insights to projects that bridge visual and textual domains.

**I am a full-stack researcher**, meaning I do everything from research to data management to training and finally deployment. I am a highly experienced technological leader and researcher, with rich theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning techniques and their usage in production environments.

**My background ranges from tiny to huge organizations**, includes both individual contribution and management, and revolves around both the latest and deepest trends and the most barebones simple approaches. I have conducted research, trained and deployed models into real products used by real users.

**I also consider myself a capable data engineer** with a strong grasp of both Python and the usual collection of auxiliary tools/frameworks our craft requires. This includes everything from managing annotation databases to querying them.

## Experience
Before embarking on my consulting career I was a computer vision research manager at [Trigo](https://www.trigoretail.com){:target="_blank"}. Before *Trigo* I was a machine learning research scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}'s *Lab126*. I was also extremely lucky to work on my MSc thesis at [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com){:target="_blank"} as an Imagineering intern, under the supervision of [Prof. Arik Shamir](https://faculty.runi.ac.il/arik/site/index.asp){:target="_blank"}.


I hold an M.Sc and a B.Sc in Computer Science from the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel**, and a minor in Visual Communications from **Bezalel Academy for Art and Design**.

As a consultant I was lucky enough to work with
