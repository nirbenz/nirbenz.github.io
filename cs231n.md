Between 2017 and 2020 and along with [Uri Eliabayev](https://www.machinelearning.co.il), [Eran Paz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eranpaz/) and [Gil Levi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillevi/?originalSubdomain=il)
(and assisted by many others), I taught teaching a free community deep learning course at Google's Tel-Aviv campus.

The course is one of many projects associated and supported by MDLI - Israel's prominent machine and deep learning community (30k+ members as of 2023).

During our course students learn how to employ Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition using Python and PyTorch/TensorFlow. This is the boring part, though; For every course we pair our graduates with Israel's industry leading machine learning researchers as mentors for final projects. Needless to say, a large part of our students ended up joining their mentors' organisations afterwards for full time employment. Other students coming from different backgrounds took the knowledge back to their own domain - be it Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, Economics etc.
