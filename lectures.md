I love sharing knowledge with people from all sorts of backgrounds. It's not my main line of work, but since 2022 I've been giving those main talks:

1. **What I Talk About When I Talk About Deep Learning** - a 60 minute introductory talk aimed at people with *technical backgrounds* that want to understand what deep learning is about. The targeted audience are software engineenirs working on an ML-heavy project who wish to better understand the tech jargon that their colleagues use. [Full syllabus here](../dl_lecture).

<!-- 2. **Introduction to Image/Video Generation** - a 90 minute talk that is targetted at machine-learning savvy people who *need* to understand the latest trends in *Generative Models for Computer Vision*. I start from GANs and finish with current diffusion/flow-models (SD to Flux) and their more recent video derivatives.

3. **A Practical Introduction to LLMs** - a practical and thorough introduction to current language models - from small (BERT) to large (GPT-3 and up) ones - and their common usage patterns. A technical talk for engineering teams with familiarity with ML products. -->

2. **A Hands-On RAG Workshop** - a full, *3-4 hours* hands-on workshop in which participants learn how to build a working retrieval database using their own data. Chunking, vector-databases, advanced retrieval techniques, reranking are all discussed, *practiced* with the goal being providing developers this knowledge to use for building products. [Full syllabus here](../rag_workshop).

If you feel one of those talks can fit your organization, or if you think my work can be of interest to your group, let's [talk](mailto:me@nirbenzvi.com).
