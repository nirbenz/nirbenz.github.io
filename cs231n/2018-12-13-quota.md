In this guide we will learn how to increase quotas for a GCP project.


# When you are *not* using an instance - stop it

Now that we are done with this, let's SSH into our machine like we learned in the [previous guide](https://nirbenz.github.io/gce-tutorial/).


# Quotas

## What are Quotas?

Theoretically, as a paying (well, using credits) GCP user you can use all the mighty power of their cloud platform. However, this power doesn't come immediately - you need to ask for it first. By default, projects have a limit to the amount of computing resources they can use. This limit is called *quota*.

### What is Limited?

Quotas exist for *everything* - GPUs, megabytes (in terms of storage), RAM, CPUs, network access etc. It is very common to have to request increase when working on a large project with numerous running instances.

It's important to note that **quotas are counted for every existing instance - even if it's not running!**.


## Increase Quotas

Okay. Let's go to the *quotas* dashboard. Enter 'quota' in the search box like below:


-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota1.png)
-

We need *All Quotas*. Next, for **metric** choose **K80 GPUs** as below.

-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota2.png)
-

Scroll down and choose the right region - reminder we are using **us-west** (we are using **us-west-1b** but the *1b* isn't relevant now).


-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota3.png)
-

Now go up and click **Edit Quotas**

-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota4.png)
-

Enter the relevant details as below, click *next*


-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota5.png)
-

And enter some reason why you want the quota increase.


-
![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/quota6.png)
-

You should soon receive an email from Google saying the request has been registered - and a while later (can be a few hours and sometimes days even) you will receive an email saying your quota increase has been approved.

### Increase 'GPUS\_ALL\_REGIONS' Quota
This part is new. As described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53415180/gcp-error-quota-gpus-all-regions-exceeded-limit-0-0-globally), one now needs to also increase `GPUS_ALL_REGIONS`. Find it using the Metric GPSs (all regions) as below.

-
![gpu_all]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/gpu_quota_all_regons.png)
-

From now continue as before. Ask for anywhere between one and 8 GPUs (you can increase this again later for the projects part of the course).

Without that, you won't be able to create the correct instance.

# Now, Shut Down Your Instance!
