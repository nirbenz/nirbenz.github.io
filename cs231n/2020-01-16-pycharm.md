Quick and dirty guide to connecting PyCharm to your instance. Aimed at advanced users.

#when you are *not* using an instance - stop it

## Using SSH-Keys to Connect

### Create SSH Key

We will create a *key-pair* of private and public keys. The private key will be used to connect to the instance, where the *public* key will be stores.

To create a key we need to invoke this at a terminal

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m pem -f ~/.ssh/cs231n
```

This will create two files, `cs231n.pub` and `cs231n`, with the former beind the public key and latter being the private one.
Following this, we want to copy the *public* key so we could use it with GCP. Do this by:

```
cat ~/.ssh/cs231n.pub
```

This will output the newly created key:

```
ssh-rsa AAASGASDASDNEAAAADAQABAAABAQDklaF5qQ/FTi9Fkfgk3tcB3sRyjSPbDQBmxEEYbM2umTuBZoUvAznASDt3fzpFLcKe3DTf3eY0xO9HG8xvUFtGFJwOyYzns59lXmK6iNWhZ4tF0BJgz7IScQ6NTkKVKxMzTQLdruDhLRBP6l+2FxMCU2Ar6s57uv8baerwgom+Z80cX62Lt+mrh50pH+czGSRi4ibAwQkJ5IePM7ncrhiqFmKzWGHxuWo4VRtQioZE3AbKdpaJv6f94SvINHo90AUV+58uwJjPPWchDLbAOkhMX7OatqGj/lVWTAnMXfvIYIsZxm8DEBS7UltATYOdtpapBtsE7T/zr9pGd4ghY21 user@Machine
```

Copy this. Now, go into your instance list and click the instance you wish to connect to. Inside the instance screen hit `Edit` at the top. You *don't* need to stop your instance for this part.

Once inside the `Edit` screen, locate the SSH key part:

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/gcp_ssh1.png)

And *paste* the public key you have copied like below:

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/gcp_ssh2.png)

Done! Click `Save` and we are ready to go. Updating might take a few moments.

### Use The Key With The Instance

To connect to the instance using the newly created key - invoke:

```
ssh -v -i "~/.ssh/cs231n" $USER@34.82.208.53
```

Assuming the process worked, you will now be inside the instance. We are doen with this part. Note that you can generally use this method in the future instead of Google `gcloud` CLI.

## PyCharm 

### Create a Deployment Config

Go into PyCharm and create a new project. No go into `Tools->Deployment->Configurations` and click the *plus* button to create a new `SFTP` config. In that window, enter the username, instance IP address and the path to the *private* key that we created earlier. Should look like this:

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/pycharm1.png)

Assuming you did everything correctly, you should be able to log into the instance by clicking `Test Connection`.

### Create a Remote Interpreter

So far we have defined a constantly updating remote directory, but we want to be able to also run the remote system's Python directly from PyCharm. To do this, go into `Preferences->Project->Project Interpreter`. 

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/pycharm2.png)

Click the cogwheel at the top right and a new window will open.

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/pycharm3.png)

Choose `SSH Interpreter` and use the existing configuration we have created before. When prompted to either `Move` or `Create a copy`, click `Move` and his `Next`.

![first time]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cs231n/pycharm/pycharm4.png)

In the next screen you will need to input the remote *conda* python interpeter. The default is the system python which we don't want to use as it lacks the necessary libraries we have installed before. The *conda* python path is usually `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python`.

Next, you'll need to input the mappings from this project to the remote path. Once you are done with this, hit `Finish`. PyCharm will take some time to upload some necessary files to the server, called *PyCharm Helpers*.

### Running a Script From The Instance
You can now create a new `.py` file and test it. I used the following code:

```
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["hostname"])
```

This should print your remote system's hostname. We are done!
