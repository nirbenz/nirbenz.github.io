Quick guide to adding the GCP credits we received for this course. But - lest we forget:


#when you are *not* using an instance - stop it

You might be asked to **upgrade your trial account** before you can redeem your coupon. Do that. Go back to Billing and click your billing account (you should have just one). It should now look like this, with the circled row being the free credits we received. Thanks Google!
