During the first few months of 2025 I've explored how Model Control Protocols (MCPs) can transform Cursor from a helpful assistant into a true coding copilot. By integrating custom MCP servers and crafting focused cursorrule files, I've automated the tedious parts of my workflow-like writing detailed PR messages-and boosted the parts I actually care about. This talk shares what worked, what didn't, and how to build your own smarter, more opinionated Cursor experience.
