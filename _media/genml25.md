AI hype is everywhere. After four years of building production-tested AI products, I still have to explain that LLMs aren't a drop-in fixes for classic data problems.
Teams struggle with over-complicated solutions where classical tools would suffice, mistaking similarity for relevance, or betting big on agentic flows when bag-of-tricks NLP would save time and budget. Meanwhile, costs drop but technical debt grows, as data curation, cleaning, and operational know-how are neglected for architecture debates and API wrappers.
Instead of just highlighting the common pitfalls, this talk offers concrete, field-tested alternatives; Simple Python for complex retrieval, lightweight NLP, and cost-effective labeling. Attendees will discover how embracing practicality over hype can lead to more robust, impactful, and maintainable AI products.
