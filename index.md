I'm Nir Ben-Zvi. I am a *freelance deep learning researcher* from Tel-Aviv, Israel.

I love tackling deep learning problems, particularly ones involving images. Before doing freelance work, I've been building various ML-based products both as an individual contributor and as a research manager. I hold an MSc in CS from the Hebrew University.

For a more in-depth technical background, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/professional).
