I'm Nir Ben-Zvi. I am a *freelance machine learning researcher* from Tel-Aviv, Israel.

I love tackling machine learning problems. Before doing freelance, I've been doing cool stuff both as an individual contributor and as a research manager.

For a more in-depth technical background, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/professional).


I also like whisky.
