Welcome. I'm Nir Ben-Zvi, a *deep learning consultant* from Tel-Aviv, Israel, with a decade-long track record in research and management.

My passion lies in deep learning challenges, especially those involving images. Before consulting, I built ML-based products both as an individual contributor and as a research manager. I hold an M.Sc in CS from the Hebrew University and I love writing code.

If this is why you came here, let's [talk](mailto:me@nirbenzvi.com).

For my detailed technical experience, take a look [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/professional).
