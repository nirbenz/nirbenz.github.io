Welcome. I'm Nir Ben-Zvi, a *deep learning consultant* from Tel-Aviv, Israel, with a decade-long track record in research and management.

My passion lies in deep learning challenges, especially those involving images. Before consulting, I built ML-based products both as an individual contributor and as a research manager. I am a full-stack researcher with an M.Sc in Computer Science from the Hebrew University, and I love writing code.

<!-- I've worked with some of Israel's top companies, namely

<a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, 
<a href="https://www.hellosimply.com/">Simply</a>,

and more. -->
