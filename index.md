I'm Nir Ben-Zvi. I am a *deep learning consultant* from Tel-Aviv, Israel.

I love tackling deep learning problems, particularly ones involving images. Before becoming a consultant, I've been building various ML-based products both as an individual contributor and as a research manager. I hold an M.Sc in CS from the Hebrew University and I love writing code.

If this is why you came here, let's [talk](mailto:me@nirbenzvi.com).
