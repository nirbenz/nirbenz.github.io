I'm Nir Ben-Zvi, an *applied machine learning researcher* from Tel-Aviv, currently working as a freelancer with some of the ecosystem's best companies.

My passion lies in deep learning challenges, especially those involving images and text. Before my consulting/freelance path, I built ML-based products both as an individual contributor and as a research manager. I am a full-stack researcher with an M.Sc in Computer Science from the Hebrew University, and I love writing code.
