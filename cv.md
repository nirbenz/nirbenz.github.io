# Professional Experience

**Machine Learning Freelancer/Consultant** (2021-present)

* Solving complex machine learning business problems in the domains of images, video and text-processing.  
* Writing production-grade code covering object detection, semantic segmentation, image generation, text-retrieval, knowledge graph traversal, among others.  
* Working either as a squad-leader, individual contributor or a full team-member within organizations of varying sizes.  
* My work has measurable business impact and requires careful research rather than off-the-shelf solutions. Projects typically span weeks to several months.  
* Partial list of clients: [Mixtiles](https://mixtiles.com/), [Simply](https://hellosimply.com/), [Deci.AI](https://www.deci.ai), [Lemonade](https://www.lemonade.com/), DeepChecks, CommonGround, Papaya-Global and KLA-Tencor.

**Deep Learning Research Manager, Trigo** (2018-2021)

* First computer vision hire at an early pre-seed stage.  
* Researched, implemented and shipped Trigo’s first computer vision/deep learning models which ran in real-time in a real supermarket in London.  
* Scaled machine learning R\&D from garage phase (\<10 employees) to 100+ employees.  
* Hired, grew and led a team of top-tier ML researchers and engineers and oversaw adoption of annotation, data and engineering tools/vendors.

**Computer Vision Research Scientist, Amazon Lab126** (2015-2018)

* Researched, trained and deployed computer vision models for Amazon’s consumer devices, including the Echo Look and the Echo Show.  
* Lead the research that was the group’s first object detection model.  
* Participated in end-to-end ML research from whiteboard to working code in real Amazon products. My work spanned boilerplate, deep research and anything in-between.  
* Lead the group’s transition from Matlab to Python-based deep learning research and remained a central figure in evaluation of ML/DL frameworks within the group.

**Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer, Donde Search (Acquired by Shopify)** (2015)

* Coded Donde's first visual search engine using Caffe.

**Imagineer, Disney Research** (2013-2014)

* Research associate under supervision of Prof. Arik Shamir.  
* Researched style-transfer algorithms based on real artist data (pre-deep learning).  
* Developed image contour tracking models for artistic style transfer.

# Education

* **M.Sc, Computer Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem** (2013 – 2015\)  
* **B.Sc, Computer Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem** (2010 – 2013\)  
* **Minor in Visual Communications, Bezalel Academy of Art and Design** (2010-2014)
